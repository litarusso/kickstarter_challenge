# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to find the best way for Louise's foundrasing campaign. 


## Analysis and Challenges
I analysed the data in several ways: using launch dates and success rate and outcomes and set goals. 

### Analysis based on Launch Dates 

#### First Analysis (Theather outcomes vs. Launch)

My first analysis describes the successful and unsuccessful months of the year. In the graph, you can see that the launches that have been successful are more than the rest. Also, there are more successful launches in May than any other month of the year. It can also be seen that in December there are the same amount of sucessful and failed events. It is also possible to see that the success rate dropped after May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

#### Second Analysis (Outcomes vs. Goals)

Then, I realized the different goals of each campaign and analyzed their outcomes and compare them with their goal amount. In this second graph, we can see that when the gaol amount is less than 1000 or more than 50000, the percentage of failure increases and the percentage of success decreases. Otherwise, the percentages of failure and success are pretty stable, even if the rate of failure is more than success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

This first challange was confusing and hard to understand. I had difficulties in understanding git and github. However, working on excel was more familiar for me. Though I had to google a few things to remember how to do them. 

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

As mentioned above May is the most successful month of the year, then the success rates decreases. In December, the rate of successful launches and failed launches are approximately the same amount. 

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

It is possible to conclude that the campaignes that have a goal amount either lower than 1000 or higher than 50000 are less successful. The others have similar rates of failure and it is higher than succes rates. 

### What are some limitations of this dataset?

In this dataset, there were many unneccesary information, however, the pivot table that I have done helped me overcome this problem. 

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

I would prefer using bar graphs instead of line charts, I think it might be easier to see differences especially in the first section.
